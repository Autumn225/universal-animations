## Release 0.0.4
- Animations for weapon attacks, uses base item for weapon, details based on hit/miss, damage type, and if critical.
- Better recognition for other animations: 
  - UA will now play if the global match on an item is disabled.
  - UA will not play if an item macro is found on the item with "new Sequence()" anywhere in it.
- Changed how "is hit" is tracked.
### *Notes*
- Weapon animations are free version only currently, patreon versions will be added next (likely tomorrow). This means some of them are a little janky due to not having animations.
- Proper way to disable/enable UAs per item will also come soon.
